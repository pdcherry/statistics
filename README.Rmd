### emmeans: Estimated marginal means

[Link to output](https://github.com/pdcherry/statistics/blob/main/emmeans_estimated_marginal_means.md)

Estimated marginal means (EMMs, previously known as least-squares means in the context of traditional regression models) are derived by using a model to make predictions over a regular grid of predictor combinations (called a reference grid).

I use estimated marginal means to estimate the effect sizes when:

 - interaction effects are present,
 - when multiple effects are presentâ€”but are not scaled the same way (*e.g.* one effect is linear, one effect is reciprocal (1/x) ),
 - when variability is not homoscedastic (*e.g.* as in a `glm`) and I could use the confidence intervals offered by `emmeans` that I don't get with ordinary means,
 - or when the experiment's sampling is not balanced, causing some conditions to be over-weighted in the ordinary means.

### DoE: Design of Experiment

[Link to output](https://github.com/pdcherry/statistics/blob/main/doe_design_of_experiment_with_library_prep.md)

Design of Experiment principles seek to configure the samples, variables, and controls in a scientific experimental plan to answer the question posed or test the hypothesis while controlling for known sources of variability and confounding due to the methods and materials used to carry out the experiment.

Here, I use the and the standard `R` function `gen.factorial` to make a full factorial design and then use the package `AlgDesign` to add blocking for two operators who will be carrying out the experiment (with n = 3 replicates for each unique sample condition).
